Adds lots of new weapons, amazing ships, diverse races and variations and a new questline - plenty of things are waiting to be found in the abandoned sectors of the Multiverse.
TRACKER sends his regards.

LOAD AFTER FORGEMASTER AND INFERNO-CORE! THEY ARE OPTIONAL BUT HEAVILY RECOMMENDED!

- Adds the Scrapper race, a new race of lanius that you can attach scrap to to upgrade them. (just talk to them!)
- Reccuring Trash Compactor boss fight with cool new loot and increasing rewards for each fight. The Transmitter is now a hidden aug! There is now NO reason you shouldn't get it (please!)
- PROTOGENS! FTL always needed cool floofy robots! Also Avalis, and soon Tabaxi, because we really need more furries. Cuteness overload!
- There's a (WIP) lore doc in mod-appendix!
- Crossover content with Forgemaster! Speaking of, you should check out Go Ballistic as well!

Coming soon: a second questline, the RECLAIM & SALVAGE ASSOCIATION, Black Rose the android renegade, Scrapper Ship Graveyard sector and so much more!

Very big thanks to (in no particular order):
Cyrus106 - Helped with most of the addon's code.
Marcrusian, Felipe - consultancy, shading, advice.
Lex - VERY comprehensive playtesting and feedback. Honorary badge of TCC.
The Ghost Hugger and Kommandant Julk - bug fixing and code sanity checks + KommJulk's inferno core thingy
GenGibs, GLAIVE, and their creator, Epirasque - all of the gibs.
GO BALLISTIC and R4V3-0N - permission to use GB-related assets and lore.
Wabbles - Banner sketches of the Trash Eater and Scrappers. Nom.
Zandoware - Did like playtesting and code stuff idk
Alder - this mod now includes Alder's amazing Instant Flair addon
Skye - helped with my sanity, I think, also made the RSA_technician recolor
Robinthedragon - funny birb mod, aka Avali

Good Luck! Don't get compacted!
