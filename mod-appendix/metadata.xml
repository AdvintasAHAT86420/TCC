Adds lots of new weapons, amazing ships, diverse races and variations and a new questline - plenty of things are waiting to be found in the abandoned sectors of the Multiverse.
TRACKER sends his regards.
- Adds the Scrapper race, a new race of lanius that you can attach scrap to to upgrade them. (just talk to them!)
- Custom made ships such as the "Fiare Vechi", "Corossus" and "Reactive Compactor". 
- Reccuring Trash Compactor boss fight with cool new loot and increasing rewards for each fight.
- The Transmitter is now a hidden aug! There is now NO reason you shouldn't get it (please!)
Coming soon: a second questline, Protogen race, EVEN MORE ships, the RECLAIM & SALVAGE ASSOCIATION, Black Rose the android renegade and more!
