Special Thanks to Cyrus106 for inspiring me to do this and helping me begin my journey!


Adds lots of new flak weapons, new ships, a new questline and new races - plenty of stories are to be found in the abandoned sectors of the Multiverse.
TRACKER sends his regards.

Changes:
- Adds the scrapper race, a new race of lanius that you can attach scrap to to upgrade them (just talk to them!). 
- Revamped a lot of old ships and weapons.
- Added a bunch more weapons, drones and ships. 
- The Trash Eater works properly now!
- Balanced the Trash Compactor boss.
- The Transmitter is now a hidden aug! There is now NO reason you shouldn't get it (please).
- Removed the imposter regrettably. 
- The Trash Compactor ship is currently in a transitional period and is not unlockable at the moment. 
- Probably more stuff too that I forgot

Good Luck! Don't get compacted!

Works with Multiverse 5.2.3
