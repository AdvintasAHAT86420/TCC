# FEATURED MODS

A "side quest" of ours is to try and compile similar high quality mods together in order to improve the entire collection! So far we've acquired (in chronological order) Kivie Takeover, Bomb Flaks, Instant Flair, Avali, FEDERATION SPECIAL FORCES, Leah Gaming, Relic Revival and RSC! 
Credits to LandGreen, Choosechee, Alder, Robinthedragon2, Pedrosian96, NewtonsFourth, Protosteel and mr_eazy_money for the sprites they've provided.

We also ported several ships to Hyperspace + MV, such as the Potential and Stalwart Defense!

### LOAD ORDER SHENANIGANS

FTL: Multiverse (and by extension Hyperspace) is absolutely necessary for this mod to run! Load it as your first mod.

We RECOMMEND that you get Inferno-Core and load it BEFORE the TCC. We also recommend Forgemaster, Go Ballistic and Generated Gibs (loaded AFTER the TCC).

# DESCRIPTION

NEW WEAPONS
    Singularity Projectors, Mass Drivers, big gatling guns, Flaks of all kinds, sizes and shapes and so much more!

NEW SHIPS
    Featuring the Scrapper Lanius ship line as well as Protogen Project, Avali, RECLAIM and SALVAGE + an entire page of Federation military ships!
    Also featuring the Extraelite packs - hunt down specific targets with specific, high-powered setups!

NEW RACES
    Lanius Scrappers, Protogens, Avali, Sergals, Sentient Robots, Kivies, Tabaxis and quite a few more!

NEW SECTORS AND EVENTS
    The Ship Graveyard (Scrapper and RSA hostile sector) and Avali Collective (Avali and Protogen friendly sector)

# HOW TO INSTALL

1.  Make sure you have the latest FTL Multiverse version, right now that is 5.2.3.
2.  Make sure you have the latest Hyperspace .dll and lua .dll taken from the FTL Multiverse discord (#hyperspace-betas channel)
(OPTIONAL) If you have Forgemaster and/or Inferno-Core, please patch them before the TCC!
3.  Compress the 4 folders (audio/,img/,data/ and mod-appendix/) into a zip file then rename the extension to .ftl (not necessary if you're using a pre-compiled version)
4.  Place it in your mods/ folder and patch it using Slipstream. Make sure the load order is correct (first MV, then Forgemaster and Inferno-Core IF you have them, then the TCC, then other mods you might have).
5.  Have fun (this is mandatory)

# CHANGELOG

### Update 1.15
- Federation Special Forces + Leah Gaming ship have been added, obviously. Minor bug fixes have been done to all of them.
- Corrosus B and C layouts now exist -  on a related note, Construction Crew Kestrel is now a completely separate ship, not SDM B.
- new crew types such as Cheese the Sergal, the upgradable Sentient robot race and RSA Hive Mantises.
- complete rework of the SDM - B and C layout coming soon.
- added several new ships such as the Tanker, Military Surplus and 'Outpost 31'.
- Trash Compactor 3 fight has been reworked from ground up. There's a new Scrapper variant now called the Scrapper defender.
- RSA technicians now have a PORTABLE TANK. This is like the most radical change idk.
- Trash_call event is no longer appended to the gigantic text wall at the beginning. Quality of life!
- new weapons such as the Overlord laser and a few new Bomb Flaks variants (Recycler, Lockdown, Fire)

Update 1.1
- SCRAPPERS! A new subfaction of Lanius with a pretty fun backstory.
- The RAPTOR's Right Hand flak, Raptor LMG, Lance Antipersonnel, SCRAPFLAK, Unscrapflak, Rescrapflak, RSA TAGGER and MINICANNON and Deconstructor Beam + a few others I can't recall rn;
- Loads of playable ships such as the hastily put-together Corossus, the civilian-spec The Original and the boarding madness of Razormind
- Fixed several animations such as the singularity and the tear gas. Yes, I added tear gas to FTL. Fight me. (I've got tear gas, I'll win.)
- Merged with Bomb Flaks, bringing said bomb flaks (+ a new bomb flak 3 sprite as well as a conservative b. flak, pre-emptive b. flak and a drone b. flak) and their related events into this mod - the old bomb flak was rebranded into Explosive Flak.
- Merged with Kivie Takeover, bringing in the Kivies as RSA Kivie Grunts, as well as the Laser Centrifuge weapon (so far!). Stay tuned for more Kivie Takeover stuff.
- Merged with Avali, adding cute floofy birbs - removed GB dependency, removed weird bugs related to load order, added Avalis to multiple TCC ships that didn't have 'em before.
- Removed the impostor, regrettably... Added sus_death.png in the img/ folder to compensate for the loss of sus-ness.
- Added remade sprites for ships such as the Armored Wasp, The Original and Reactive Compactor thanks to ConMan.
- Soft-Merged with Instant Flair
