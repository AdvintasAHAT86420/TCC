Special Thanks to Cyrus106 for inspiring me to do this and helping me begin my journey! Thank you for everyone involved, we never thought this mod would become as big as it did!

# FEATURED MODS

A "side quest" of ours is to try and compile similar high quality mods together in order to improve the entire collection! So far we've acquired (in chronological order) Kivie Takeover, Bomb Flaks, Instant Flair, Avali, FEDERATION SPECIAL FORCES and Leah Gaming! 

We also ported several ships to Hyperspace + MV, such as the Potential, Stalwart Defense and Sovereign Star!

### LOAD ORDER SHENANIGANS

FTL: Multiverse (and by extension Hyperspace) is absolutely necessary for this mod to run! Load it as your first mod.

We also RECOMMEND that you get Forgemaster, Inferno-Core and Go Ballistic and load them BEFORE the TCC. They are completely optional, though.

# DESCRIPTION

Adds lots of new weapons, amazing ships, diverse races and variations and a new questline - plenty of things are waiting to be found in the abandoned sectors of the Multiverse.
TRACKER sends his regards.

- Adds the Scrapper race, a new race of lanius that you can attach scrap to to upgrade them. (just talk to them!)
- Custom made ships such as the "Fiare Vechi", "Corossus" and "Reactive Compactor". 
- Reccuring Trash Compactor boss fight with cool new loot and increasing rewards for each fight. Once you get a certain augment in the first sector, you can summon the TC whenever at a storage check.
- The Transmitter is now a hidden aug! There is now NO reason you shouldn't get it (please!)
- PROTOGENS! FTL always needed cool floofy robots!

Coming soon: a second questline, the RECLAIM & SALVAGE ASSOCIATION, Black Rose the android renegade, Scrapper Graveyard and more!
P.S. The protogen spritesheet exists as an outline - if you wish to fill it in and include it in the mod, please give Dalvest a DM. Thanks! 

There's a lore doc in mod-appendix too, btw.

Good Luck! Don't get compacted!

# HOW TO INSTALL

1.  Make sure you have the latest FTL Multiverse version, right now that is 5.2.3.
2.  Make sure you have the latest Hyperspace beta .dll and lua .dll taken from the FTL Multiverse discord.
(OPTIONAL) If you have Forgemaster and/or Inferno-Core, please patch them before the TCC!
3.  Compress the 4 folders (audio/,img/,data/ and mod-appendix/) into a zip file then rename the extension to .ftl (not necessary if you're using a pre-compiled version)
4.  Place it in your mods/ folder and patch it using Slipstream. Make sure the load order is correct (first MV, then Forgemaster and Inferno-Core IF you have them, then the TCC, then other mods you might have).
5.  Have fun (this is mandatory)

# CHANGELOG

### Update 1.1
- SCRAPPERS! A new subfaction of Lanius with a pretty fun backstory.
- The RAPTOR's Right Hand flak, Raptor LMG, Lance Antipersonnel, SCRAPFLAK, Unscrapflak, Rescrapflak, RSA TAGGER and MINICANNON and Deconstructor Beam + a few others I can't recall rn;
- Loads of playable ships such as the hastily put-together Corossus, the civilian-spec The Original and the boarding madness of Razormind
- Fixed several animations such as the singularity and the tear gas. Yes, I added tear gas to FTL. Fight me. (I've got tear gas, I'll win.)
- Merged with Bomb Flaks, bringing said bomb flaks (+ a new bomb flak 3 sprite as well as a conservative b. flak, pre-emptive b. flak and a drone b. flak) and their related events into this mod - the old bomb flak was rebranded into Explosive Flak.
- Merged with Kivie Takeover, bringing in the Kivies as RSA Kivie Grunts, as well as the Laser Centrifuge weapon (so far!). Stay tuned for more Kivie Takeover stuff.
- Merged with Avali, adding cute floofy birbs - removed GB dependency, removed weird bugs related to load order, added Avalis to multiple TCC ships that didn't have 'em before.
- Removed the impostor, regrettably... Added sus_death.png in the img/ folder to compensate for the loss of sus-ness.
- Added remade sprites for ships such as the Armored Wasp, The Original and Reactive Compactor thanks to ConMan.
- Soft-Merged with Instant Flair
