		<text>By the time you notice the Rebel ship behind the beacon, it's too late to avoid a fight.</text>
		<text>A Rebel ship hails. "We did not fight a war to let a single Federation ship shatter our dreams of a better galaxy!" He locks weapons.</text>
		<text>A Rebel ship approaches cautiously. "Personally," says the captain, "I'd have stuck with the Federation. But I'm a soldier, sir, and I'm no use without a war to fight. Raise your shields!"</text>
		<text>You're hailed by a Rebel ship: "When the rebellion is complete you'll see the safer world we provide. Well, you won't, but you get the point." They arm weapons.</text>

Please destroy them before the pills--" The Illuminant cuts him off. "Hey, shut up! I have all the liscensing i need to sell my medication!
