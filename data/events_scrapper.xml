Cooperation and sharing of knowledge among Scrappers might occur within their own communities but may not extend readily to outsiders.</text>
	<text>Scrappers seem to have a strong sense of self-reliance and resourcefulness, as they must navigate dangerous and unpredictable environments to find valuable scraps. They possess specialized knowledge about identifying and extracting useful materials from various sources, especially wrecked spacecraft and technological remnants.</text>

    <text>A formidable Scrapper Outpost has taken root in this sector. Could it serve as a covert hub for cutting-edge research or as a strategic military stronghold, concealed from prying eyes?</text>
